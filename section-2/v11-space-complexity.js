// Space complexity in js

// Rules of thumb

/* 1. Most primitives (booleans, numbers, undefined , null) are constant space.
   2. String require O(n) space (where n is the string length)
   3. Reference types are generally O(n) =, where n is the length (for arrays) or the number of keys (for objects)
   4.
